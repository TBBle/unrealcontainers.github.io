## Building from source

The site is implemented using the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) static site generator and targets GitHub pages. You can use the [GitHub Pages Ruby Gem](https://github.com/github/pages-gem) to install all of the necessary dependencies to build and run the site locally. Once the dependencies are installed, generate and start the local server by running the command:

```
jekyll serve
```
